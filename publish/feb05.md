# âœ” **`tick_data.clear()`**: Clears the deque **before** adding new data, ensuring it starts from an empty state.  
âœ” **Copying `tick_data` before clearing**: This prevents modifying the deque while inserting into the database.  
âœ” **Avoids reprocessing the same 1000 items again and again**.

Now, every time the deque reaches its limit, it will **flush to PostgreSQL, reset to zero, and start fresh**.

Let me know if you need further tweaks! ðŸš€
